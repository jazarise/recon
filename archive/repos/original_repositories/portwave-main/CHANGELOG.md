## [0.8.0] — 2026-04-20

### Changed — memory & speed at scale (no behavior change)

- **Iterator-based producer.** `per_net: Vec<Vec<IpAddr>>` +
  `round_robin: Vec<IpAddr>` materialisations (which copied every IP in the
  scan scope into RAM twice) are gone. The producer now walks
  `Vec<(IpNetwork, IpNetworkIterator)>` round-robin on the fly. Memory drops
  from **O(IPs × 2)** to **O(nets)** — a `/8` scan went from ~128 MB up-front
  to ~24 bytes per input net. Enables sustained scans of `/8+` ranges without
  pressuring RAM.
- **Numeric-order sort of `open_records`.** v0.7.x sorted by `(String, u16)`
  which put `"10.0.0.1"` *before* `"9.0.0.1"` lexicographically. Now uses
  `sort_by_cached_key` over `(IpAddr, u16)` — correct numeric order + parses
  each IP once instead of on every comparison.
- **Bounded `hit_tx` channel (was unbounded).** Capped at 2048 so Phase A
  workers can't let the hit-queue grow without bound on pathological scans.
- **FxHashSet for resume skip/prior sets.** ~4× faster lookups on the hot
  path (SocketAddr key). `HashSet<SocketAddr>` → `FxHashSet<SocketAddr>`.
- **Batched `pb.inc()`.** Workers accumulate 64 probes locally before
  touching indicatif's internal mutex. Removes 3-5 % of CPU spent on bar
  contention at 10–15 K probes/sec × 1500 workers.
- **Fast-path semaphore bypass.** Workers now check
  `stats.adaptive_shrunk: AtomicBool` before `sem.acquire_owned()`. In the
  common "not shrunk" state (which is true 100 % of the time on healthy
  networks) the semaphore call is skipped entirely — it was always a no-op
  there anyway. 3-5 % additional hot-path CPU saving.
- **Throttled `pb.set_message`.** Previously a String-allocating format on
  every open; now rate-limited to 1 Hz per worker. Cleaner logs on hot /24s.

### Fixed

- **Producer hang on Ctrl+C during backpressure.** `send_or_shutdown()`
  replaces raw `tx.send_async(sa).await` — try_send fast path, and on a
  backpressured channel races the send against a 100 ms timer so a
  shutdown flag flip is observed within ≤ 100 ms. Previously a
  Ctrl+C while the producer was waiting on a full channel could take
  seconds to propagate.
- **Phase B hang on Ctrl+C.** The enrichment JoinSet drain loop now
  checks `stats.shutdown` after each task completes and calls
  `set.abort_all()` on detection. Previously a scan with 10k hits could
  take a minute or more of enrichment to drain after Ctrl+C.
- **Panic on semaphore close during Phase B.** `enrich_sem.acquire_owned()
  .await.unwrap()` → `let Ok(p) = ... else { break; };`. Graceful.
- **Monitor-abort no longer triggers Phase B shutdown.** Previous versions
  set `stats.shutdown = true` after Phase A to stop the adaptive monitor,
  but now that Phase B treats that flag as "user cancelled", we abort the
  monitor's `JoinHandle` directly instead.

### Added — observability

- **`[priority]` heartbeat line.** A background task watches
  `stats.priority_done`; prints one line the moment the top-20 sweep has
  been fully enqueued ("top-20 ports enqueued — N open so far, continuing").
  Gives users a mid-scan heartbeat on long runs.
- **Phase timing in `scan_summary.json`.** New fields `phase_a_ms`,
  `phase_b_ms`, `udp_ms`, `httpx_ms`, `nuclei_ms`. Summary is rewritten
  after httpx + nuclei finish so the file always reflects the final state.

### Verified

- Linux `cargo build --release` clean, zero warnings.
- Windows `cargo check --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu --release` clean.
- Localhost `/32` smoke: 15 opens, sort order numeric
  (`22 → 80 → 443 → 631 → 1080 → 3389 → …`), `phase_a_ms=128`,
  `phase_b_ms=1205`.
- Scope-filter (v0.7.1 regression): still drops prior-scope entries.
- CDN tagging regression: `104.16.1.1:80 [http, cdn:cloudflare]` works.
- Port-range parser regression: `"80,443,8000-8002,9998"` → 6 ports.

## [0.7.1] — 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Resume + scan_diff leaked IPs from previous-scope scans.** When the same
  folder name was reused across different target inputs (e.g. one day
  `portwave local 192.168.1.0/24`, next day `portwave local 185.80.124.0/22`),
  the prior `open_ports.jsonl` was fully loaded without scope filtering —
  so the new scan's OPEN PORTS block, output files, and diff baseline all
  included old 192.168.1.* entries unrelated to the current CIDR. Resume
  state (`preserved`, `skip_set`) and the diff baseline (`prior_set`) are
  now scope-filtered against the current `<CIDR_INPUT>` minus `--exclude`
  before anything downstream reads them. Log lines explain the cull:
  `Resume: discarded N prior open port(s) outside the current scan scope.`
- **`scan_diff.json` could go stale across re-runs.** v0.7.0 skipped writing
  a diff when both current and prior sets were empty, leaving the diff
  file from a previous (different-scope) run on disk. Diff is now written
  every single run — empty state reads `{prior_opens:0, current_opens:0,
  new:[], closed:[], unchanged:0}` plus the log line
  `Diff: no opens this run (and no prior in scope)`.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Smart port prioritization.** The producer now runs a **two-pass sweep**:
  pass 1 scans a curated top-20 priority list (`80, 443, 22, 21, 25, 53,
  8080, 8443, 3389, 110, 143, 445, 3306, 5432, 6379, 27017, 9200, 1883,
  5900, 11211`) across every IP, pass 2 does the remainder. On long scans
  users see HTTP/SSH/DB hits in the first few seconds instead of waiting
  for the full port sweep to finish. Priority order is stable regardless
  of input source (`--ports`, `--port-file`, embedded).
- **`scan_diff.json`.** Every scan reads the prior `open_ports.jsonl` before
  overwriting it and writes a diff to `scan_diff.json`:
  `{prior_opens, current_opens, new:[…], closed:[…], unchanged:N}`.
  Independent of `--no-resume` — diff always runs when a prior file exists.
  Perfect for continuous-monitoring cron + webhook workflows.
- **`--webhook <URL>`.** POSTs `scan_summary.json` (with `scan_diff.json`
  merged under a `diff` key) to the URL when the workflow finishes. Silent
  on failure so a flaky collector never breaks the exit code. Works with
  Slack/Discord/custom endpoints.
- **`--udp` opt-in UDP discovery phase.** Curated set of protocol-specific
  probes against ~15 well-known UDP services: DNS 53, NTP 123, SNMP 161,
  SSDP 1900, mDNS 5353, NetBIOS 137, MSSQL-browser 1434, portmap 111,
  TFTP 69, IKE 500, OpenVPN 1194, memcached 11211, WireGuard 51820,
  NFS 2049, QUIC 443. Responses appear in `open_ports.jsonl` with
  `protocol: "udp/<label>"` and a best-effort ASCII-cleaned banner.
  Off by default because UDP without ICMP port-unreachable reads (which
  would require root) only catches services that actively reply to our
  specific probe.
- **`--refresh-cdn`.** Re-fetches live edge ranges from Cloudflare
  (`https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v4`) + Fastly (`https://api.fastly.com/
  public-ip-list`), merges with the embedded snapshot's non-API providers
  (akamai/sucuri/imperva/stackpath/bunnycdn/cachefly/keycdn), writes to
  `~/.cache/portwave/cdn-ranges.txt` (Unix) or
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\portwave\cdn-ranges.txt` (Windows). `load_cdn_ranges()`
  prefers this cache file over the compiled-in snapshot at runtime, so
  users can keep CDN coverage current between portwave releases.

## [0.6.6] — 2026-04-17

### Changed
- Narrowed the nuclei non-HTTP port filter from ~70 ports down to 18.
  The v0.6.4 blocklist excluded SSH/22, Redis/6379, MongoDB/27017,
  VNC/5900, MQTT/1883, MySQL/3306, etc. — all ports where nuclei has
  working templates (`ssh-auth-methods`, `redis-default-login`,
  `mongodb-unauth`, `vnc-without-pass`, `mqtt-*`, `mysql-weak-auth`).
  Filter was silently dropping real findings. Now blocks only ports with
  essentially zero nuclei coverage: 7/9/13/17/19/37 (toy services), 53
  (DNS-TCP), 67/68 (DHCP), 69 (TFTP), 109 (POP2), 111 (portmap), 123
  (NTP), 137/138 (NetBIOS name/dgram), 161/162 (SNMP), 179 (BGP), 514
  (syslog), 543/544 (klogin/kshell), 4789 (VXLAN).
- Removed the banner-protocol short-circuit in `is_http_candidate` —
  the banner classifier correctly tags SSH/SMTP/FTP/POP3/IMAP, which
  are all protocols nuclei explicitly supports.

## [0.6.5] — 2026-04-17

### Changed
- `--nuclei-concurrency` default lowered 50 → 25 to match
  `--nuclei-max-host-error`. Silences nuclei's "concurrency value is
  higher than max-host-error" warning and removes the silent cap nuclei
  was applying. Users who want higher concurrency can pass both flags.

## [0.6.4] — 2026-04-17

### Added
- `--nuclei-max-host-error` (default `25`) — passes `-mhe 25` to nuclei
  so doomed hosts fail fast.
- Non-HTTP port filter on `nuclei_targets.txt` (can be disabled with
  `--nuclei-all-ports`). Aggressive in this version — narrowed in 0.6.6.

## [0.6.3] — 2026-04-17

### Changed
- Replaced the block-font ASCII banner (which piled up backslashes in
  the `W`+`A` glyphs and rendered chaotically on narrow terminals) with
  the standard figlet mixed-case font for "portwave".

## [0.6.2] — 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- **Adaptive controller mistook firewalled targets for local saturation.**
  Previous versions shrank the worker pool when `timeouts / attempts`
  exceeded 30 %. But 100 % timeouts has two totally different causes:
  (a) local resource exhaustion (correct response: shrink), or
  (b) the target is firewalled (correct response: do nothing). The
  heuristic couldn't tell them apart and always assumed (a). On a /24
  with 99 %+ dead IPs — including localhost `127.0.0.0/24` — it would
  shrink from 1500 to 64 workers, turning a 3-minute scan into 30 min.
  Rewrote the controller to watch actual local-resource errors only
  (`AddrNotAvailable`, `EMFILE`, `ENFILE`, `ENOBUFS`, `EAGAIN` via
  `raw_os_error`). Timeouts are now purely informational.

## [0.6.1] — 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- **Adaptive controller shrinking too aggressively.** With `--retries 1` (the
  new default), every timed-out probe incremented the `timeouts` counter
  twice (once per retry). The adaptive monitor's `timeouts / attempts`
  ratio exceeded 100 % (shown as "200 %" in logs) and shrank the worker
  pool exponentially — down to ~64 workers per scan against heavily
  firewalled /24s. Now a timed-out probe increments the counter exactly
  once, and the ratio stays in `[0.0, 1.0]` as intended.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-04-17

### Added
- **`--input-file PATH`** — one target per line (CIDR / IP / IP range, `#`
  comments). Accepts stdin via `-`.
- **`--asn AS13335,AS15169`** — expands ASN to announced prefixes via the
  public RIPE stat API (no API key needed). Multi-ASN comma-separated.
- **`--exclude LIST`** — skip CIDRs / IPs / IP ranges (scope discipline).
  Same input format as `<CIDR_INPUT>`.
- **`--ports "22,80,443,8000-9000"`** — inline port-range syntax.
  Overrides `--port-file` and the embedded list.
- **IP-range input everywhere**: `1.2.3.10-1.2.3.20` → minimal covering
  CIDR blocks, accepted anywhere a target is expected.
- **CDN / WAF edge tagging.** Every open port on an IP in a known CDN
  range is tagged `[cdn:<provider>]` (cloudflare, fastly, akamai,
  imperva, sucuri, stackpath, bunnycdn, cachefly, keycdn). Bundled
  static list of 89 IPv4 CIDRs compiled into the binary via
  `include_str!`. `scan_summary.json` gains `by_cdn` + `cdn_count`.
- **ASCII startup banner.** Cyan `portwave` art + "by assassin_marcos"
  byline, auto-suppressed on non-TTY stderr.
- **`--no-art` + `-q, --quiet`** flags.
- **`ureq` dep (~400 KB)** for the GitHub tags API peek (see below).

### Changed
- **`--check-update`** now peeks the GitHub tags API alongside the
  releases API. When a tag is pushed but CI hasn't uploaded release
  assets yet, reports "tag vX is pushed but CI is still building" —
  no more "says up-to-date, but `-u` finds newer" confusion.
- **README fully rewritten** for v0.6.x usage. No more install-section
  duplication from incremental edits across 0.5.x.

### Fixed
- **`refresh_bundled_ports_files()` now follows `PORTWAVE_PORTS`** from
  env + config. Older installs whose config pointed at the repo-clone
  `/ports/portwave-top-ports.txt` were never refreshed on `--update`.
  Now they are, canonicalised for de-dup.

## [0.5.6] — 2026-04-17

### Added
- **`--- OPEN PORTS (N) ---`** summary block printed between scan
  completion and the httpx step. Shows `ip:port [protocol, tls, cdn]
  banner` so it's obvious why httpx might report fewer URLs than the
  open-port count (non-HTTP services like SSH drop out silently).

## [0.5.5] — 2026-04-17

### Changed
- **Default `--threads` 4000 → 1500.** 4000 exhausts the ephemeral port
  range on long scans (99 %+ timeout rate observed). 1500 is the sweet
  spot across typical Linux / macOS / Windows defaults.
- **Default `--timeout-ms` 600 → 800.** Catches slow-but-responsive
  hosts without bloating total runtime on cold targets.
- **Default `--retries` 0 → 1.** Covers transient SYN drops without
  doubling scan time (only timeouts retry, never RST/refused).

### Added
- **`SO_LINGER = 0` on every TCP connect.** Sends RST on close,
  returning the ephemeral port to the OS immediately instead of
  waiting 60 s in TIME_WAIT. Fixes the ephemeral-port-exhaustion
  cascade at scale.
- **`TCP_NODELAY` on every TCP connect.** Disables Nagle; shaves
  ~40 ms of ACK coalescing latency off each successful connect.
- **New `tcp_probe()` helper** replaces `TcpStream::connect()`
  everywhere (Phase A, Phase B, TLS sniff).
- **+28 common service ports** added to the embedded list
  (1405 → 1433): MQTT 1883/8883, ZooKeeper 2181, Cassandra 9042,
  Kafka 9092–9094, Salt 4505/4506, Zabbix-trapper 10051, Redis
  Sentinel 26379, ActiveMQ 61616, kube-scheduler 10251, kube-
  controller 10252, kubelet-ro 10255, kube-proxy-health 10256,
  STUN 3478, Erlang EPMD 4369, VXLAN 4789, Logstash 5044, Vite
  5173, CoAP 5683, TeamViewer 5938, WebSphere 9060/9061.

### Fixed
- **`install.sh` + `install.ps1`** stop writing `PORTWAVE_PORTS=<repo-
  clone>/ports/portwave-top-ports.txt` by default. The embedded list
  is the default now; `--update` auto-refreshes it. Users can still
  enter a custom path when prompted.

## [0.5.4] — 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- **CI hang on macOS Intel.** GitHub-hosted `macos-13` runners had
  very limited availability (jobs sat in the queue 28+ minutes across
  v0.5.1/0.5.2/0.5.3 and never picked up). Switched to building
  *both* Mac architectures from a single `macos-14` (Apple Silicon)
  runner using `cargo build --target x86_64-apple-darwin` — the
  Apple-bundled toolchain cross-compiles natively. One job, two
  binaries, no queue wait.
- **`install.sh` picked a prefix not on `$PATH`.** On macOS the first
  writable candidate was `~/.local/bin` which isn't on bash's default
  `$PATH`, causing `portwave: command not found` after install. New
  order: `/opt/homebrew/bin` → `/usr/local/bin` → `~/.local/bin`. If
  the chosen prefix is still not on `$PATH`, the installer offers to
  append an `export PATH=...` line to the right shell rc (`~/.zshrc`
  / `~/.bash_profile` / `~/.bashrc`).
- **`install.sh` missed many tool locations.** Expanded auto-detect
  to `$HOME/go/bin`, `$HOME/.local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`,
  `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/local/go/bin`, `/opt/local/bin` (MacPorts),
  `/home/go/bin`, `$GOBIN`, `$GOPATH/bin`, and any `/home/*/go/bin`.
  `~/.pdtm/go/bin` (ProjectDiscovery's tool manager) is picked up
  automatically via `$PATH`.

### Changed
- README rewritten end-to-end; removed install-section duplication
  introduced by incremental 0.5.0 → 0.5.3 edits.

## [0.5.3] — 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Default port list is now embedded** via `include_str!`. The binary
  *is* the port list — `--update` always ships the current list, no
  separate asset to manage.
- **`refresh_bundled_ports_files()` called after `--update`.** Rewrites
  every on-disk copy of `portwave-top-ports.txt` it finds under the
  install prefix's `share/portwave/ports/` — so configs pointing at
  the share copy stay in sync.

### Removed
- `find_bundled_ports()` runtime lookup — no longer needed.

## [0.5.2] — 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- **Producer bailed early on `/24+` ranges starting with the network
  address.** `any = true` was set *after* `is_usable_ipv4_host()` in
  the round-robin loop. For a `/24` the first IP yielded is `.0`
  (network), which is unusable → `continue` → `any` stayed `false` →
  outer loop bailed after consuming a single IP. Zero probes sent to
  workers, "open: 0" in 0 ms, progress bar forced to 100 % by
  `pb.finish_with_message`. Bug only manifested on `/24`–`/30` IPv4
  (our localhost `/32` smoke tests didn't trigger it). `any = true`
  is now set as soon as the iterator yields *any* value.

### Added
- **1405-port bundled list** (up from 443). The old list was HTTP-
  heavy and missing critical service ports — most damagingly **22
  (SSH)**, plus 25/53/110/143/445/587/993/995, 3389 (RDP), 5432
  (postgres), 5900 (VNC), 6379 (redis), 9200 (elasticsearch), 11211
  (memcached), 27017 (mongo), and many more. New list is the union
  of the old 443 + nmap-top-1000 + curated bug-bounty / modern-app
  additions (docker 2375/76, etcd 2379/80, k8s api 6443, hadoop
  50070/75/90, rabbitmq 15672, etc.).

## [0.5.1] — 2026-04-17

### Added
- **`-u, --update`** — downloads the prebuilt binary for the current
  OS+arch from the latest GitHub Release and atomically replaces the
  running executable. Powered by `self_update` over rustls + reqwest.
- **`--check-update`** — prints "Update available: X → Y" or "Up to
  date", then exits.
- **Startup update-available banner.** Cached under
  `~/.cache/portwave/last_check` (Unix) or
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\portwave\last_check` (Windows), 24 h TTL, 3 s
  timeout so slow networks never block a scan.
- **`--no-update-check`** + `PORTWAVE_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` env.
- **`.github/workflows/release.yml`** — builds binaries for
  `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `x86_64-apple-darwin`,
  `aarch64-apple-darwin`, `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` on every `v*`
  tag. Each artefact is a `tar.gz` (Unix) or `zip` (Windows) named
  `portwave-<target-triple>.{tar.gz,zip}` so `self_update` auto-
  matches on the host.

### Changed
- Positional args `<FOLDER_NAME>` + `<CIDR_INPUT>` are now `Option`
  so `--update` / `--check-update` can run without them.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-16

### Added
- **Cross-platform support.** Linux, macOS (Apple Silicon + Intel),
  and Windows. Guarded `raise_fd_limit()` with `#[cfg(unix)]`,
  platform-aware config file path (`%APPDATA%` on Windows vs
  `$HOME/.config` on Unix), broader bundled-ports lookup covering
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%` and exe-relative paths.
- **`install.sh` + `install.ps1`** — interactive installers with
  rustup auto-install, tool auto-detect, path-prefix picker, config
  file writer, PATH hint.
- **`uninstall.sh` + `uninstall.ps1`**.
- **First GitHub public release.** Repo live at
  `https://github.com/assassin-marcos/portwave`, 20 SEO topics set,
  MIT licensed.

### Changed
- Renamed package + binary from `ipv6scanner` to `portwave`.
- `libc` moved to `[target.'cfg(unix)'.dependencies]`.

### Before v0.5.0

Tool lived as `ipv6scanner` internally at v0.3.x / v0.4.x. Big
rewrites:

#### v0.4.0 (internal) — Architectural overhaul
- Bounded worker pool with `flume` MPMC queue. Memory O(threads),
  not O(IPs × ports).
- Dedicated writer task; `Arc<Mutex<File>>` on the hot path removed.
- `JoinSet` instead of `Vec<JoinHandle>`.
- `indicatif` progress bar with ETA + spinner mode for > 10 M probes.
- Structural IPv6 URL formatting — `http://[::1]` not `http://[::1`.
- Graceful `Ctrl+C` (drain workers + flush writer before exit).
- Dropped `-path /actuator,/.git/HEAD` httpx hardcode.
- Resume via append-only `open_ports.jsonl`.
- Two-phase scan: fast discovery (Phase A) + banner/TLS enrichment
  (Phase B).

#### v0.3.0 (original)
- Hybrid IPv4/IPv6 scanner with full TCP connect + httpx + nuclei
  chain.
